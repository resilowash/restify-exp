### Restify export
The app scaffolding stinks. This isn't meant to be the perfect project, just a useful restify example/set of examples

data folder simulates database for the time being. Writing notes to a json file.
perhaps find or create a good yeoman template for this.

### Todos:
- [ ] Singleton for configuration (minor)
- [ ] Consider placing configs in environment variables (minor)
- [ ] Don't store passwords for important crap in the file at least unencrypted (major)
- [ ] Automate complete database setup even with users - script it out (minor)
